**Basic Keylogger Program:-**

**Overview:-**

This project is a simple keylogger program developed as part of my internship at Prodigy Info Tech. The keylogger records and logs keystrokes,
focusing on logging the keys pressed and saving them to a file. Note: Ethical considerations and permissions are crucial for projects involving keyloggers.

**Features:-**

- **Time Logging:** Imports time details from the device and logs the date and time of each keystroke.
- **Keystroke Logging:** Records which key or letter is pressed by the user.
- **File Generation:** Generates a text file in the same location as the code, containing the keylog details in plain text format.
- **Real-time Update:** Updates the text file with keylog details for every key press while the program is running.

**Usage:-**

Ensure you have the necessary permissions and ethical considerations before running this program.
